Goal 
	Create a program that is able to read, store, and perform operations that are given in machine code.

Known
	list of operations and code for those operations that have different meanings
	Each operation will interact with memory in some way


Process
	Create an empty 100 slot memory array
	Create an accumulator, program_counter, opcode, and operatnd variables
	Create an instructionRegister ArrayList
	Create a FileReader that is reads out the file of every operation
	store all instructions from the file into instructionRegister
	Make a forloop that runs throught every instruction 
	Break instructions into operation and operand
	Make if statements for every operation that call a method for every operation
	Once all if instructions are done then display a memory dump in the way specified
